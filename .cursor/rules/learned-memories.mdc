## Development Environment

### Running Commands in Development Environment

**Always use direnv to load the development environment before running commands:**

```bash
eval "$(direnv export bash)" && <command>
```

**Important:** Never run phpunit (or other development commands) without first loading the devenv shell using direnv. The project uses devenv (via direnv) to manage the development environment, and commands must be executed within this environment to have access to the correct PHP version, dependencies, and environment variables.

**Example:**
```bash
eval "$(direnv export bash)" && php bin/phpunit
```

This ensures that:
- The correct PHP version is used
- All dependencies are available
- Environment variables are properly set
- Database connections and other services are configured correctly
